Welcome to Secure Software Development course! To be ready in the field, you will need more than just the right tools.  This course explores the vulnerabilities and associated security control methods used to implement a secure software development lifecycle. Emphasis is placed on code-level vulnerabilities, vulnerability detection and resolution, software composition with external dependencies, security scanning and analysis tools, implementing secure automated build pipelines, and secrets management. 

## Course Description ##

Secure Software Construction is designed to introduce cyber security techniques in the software development process. A java based application and associated build tools (Apache Maven, Gitlab, etc.) will be used as the method to provide hands-on experience and knowledge. The course is designed around constructing a software build pipeline that incorporates manual and automated cyber security practices as the course progresses.

Description: Admission into Bachelor of Computer Science Program. Introduction to vulnerabilities and associated security control methods used to implement a secure software development lifecycle. Emphasis is placed on code level vulnerabilities, vulnerability detection and resolution, software composition with external dependencies, security scanning and analysis tools, implementing secure automated build pipelines, and secrets management.
